Sign Language Detection using YOLOv5
ðŸš€ Real-time Sign Language Recognition system built with YOLOv5 to detect and classify hand gestures for sign language alphabets/words.

Key Features
âœ” Real-time detection using a pre-trained/custom YOLOv5 model
âœ” Supports ASL (American Sign Language) or custom gesture datasets
âœ” Easy training & inference scripts for custom datasets
âœ” Optimized for low-latency performance (can run on CPU/GPU)
âœ” Exportable to ONNX, TFLite, or CoreML for edge deployment

Use Cases
Assistive technology for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community

Educational tool for learning sign language

Integration into chatbots, avatars, or communication apps

Tech Stack
YOLOv5 (PyTorch-based object detection)

OpenCV (Real-time video processing)

Python (Backend logic & training)
